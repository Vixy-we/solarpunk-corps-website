PROMPT START

Build a complete, fully functional, modern website for Solarpunk Corps (SPC) — a newly launching multidisciplinary college club.
Use a bright, hopeful, eco-tech “solarpunk” aesthetic.
Focus on readability, storytelling, and clarity, because this site is meant to introduce the club to students, teachers, and potential sponsors.

The club is launching right now, so the website must clearly say:

“We are launching Solarpunk Corps — a new club being formed for students who want to build technology, promote sustainability, and create real social impact.”

The site must include:
✔ Homepage
✔ About Us
✔ What We Do
✔ Divisions
✔ Membership System
✔ Our Vision & Roadmap
✔ Inaugural Projects (2026 Roadmap)
✔ Sponsor Us / Why Support Us
✔ Contact & Socials
✔ Feedback Form
✔ Leadership Section
✔ FAQ

Use clean animations, clear sections, and icons.
